# hello-world
Prototypical first repository for learning GIT

Greetings Humans!

Or at least my hope is that a human is reading this file.
As we all know, it is entirely possible for a program/bot 
to be scanning the contents of this file.

It is my belief that it will be many years before a non-human 
will be able to appreciate the subtle irony of that action as 
it pertains to the intent of my message.
